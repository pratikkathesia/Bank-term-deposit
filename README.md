# Bank-term-deposit
To compare different parameters when customers accepted term deposit offer by bank

Here, there were different features collcted by bank during marketing like customer age, marital status, education, camapaign days and many more. At last, in column 'Y', the result was declared that customer took a deposit or not. 

My main goal is to analyze in which category customers accpted offer by how much percent. So, most categories have percentage of Yes and No to get the idea for future marketing. 
I have also attached the dataset for reference.
